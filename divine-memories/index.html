Thank you </i><b><i>Divine Explorer</i></b><i> for organizing this !!</i></p><p><b><i>Unfoldment Part 1 –Let Go</i></b></p><p><i>10,9.8,7.6,5,4,3,2,1.……blast off…yes we are on a earthly vehicle being transported around the galactic planets. The Navgraha temple tour under the guidance of Guruji Prem Nirmal and Guruma Bhartiji was an exalting experience. As we traversed the lands of Tamil Nadu to reach our several destinations one by one, we were immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of this enchanting state. Letting go…came easily…letting go of what we are accustomed to, was a step required to embrace whole-heartedly what this journey had to offer. The temple visits were not about ‘darshan’ but about ‘ inner darshan’- self-reflection and letting go of patterns, which blocked our paths of inner fulfillment.  Under the guidance of Guruji and Guruma who so lovingly guided us and explained the subtler aspects and the significance of each temple visit; we were truly blessed. ‘Let go’….just happened. Layers peeled off without any turmoil and seeds of transformation were sown.</i></p><p><b><i>Unfoldment Part 2- Surrender</i></b></p><p><i>What can one do, but surrender at the foothills of the magnificent Arunachaleshwar mountains. Surrender to ‘what’ and to ‘who’…….surrender your ego to your true self….surrender your limited wisdom to the all pervading truth….surrender yourself completely to your Guru. Simple facts delivered in a simple way but the effect-  profound. What happened at Thirruvanamalai….the spiritual seat in southern India…an experience- less.. experience, from enlightenment to liberation after total surrender, at feet of divine grace. Nothing can happen till one surrenders and surrender happened. The seeds of transformation had sprouted.</i></p><p><b><i>Unfoldment Part 3 - Simplicity</i></b></p><p><i>Be simple, be humble, Guruji repeats again and again…loving, gently, simply and humbly. The guru who leads by example, walks the talk. Did it take a dip in the ocean of Rameswaram or 22 buckets of well water from the temple, or was it pristine gushing zest of water from the Coutrallam waterfalls that yet again peeled layers and freed me from ‘karma’ </i><b><i>OR</i></b><i> was it observing Guruji and Guruma retain their simplicity and humility at all moments that transformation happened? Should I wonder ….the magic has started...the seeds of transformation are emerging with strong roots.</i></p><p><b><i>Manifest</i></b></p><p><i>What remains now…...maintain these lessons learnt…and manifestation will occur …until new lessons come my way….let me be a master of these. Gratitude to the divine grace. </i></p><p><i>Gratitude to </i><b><i>Divine Explorer</i></b><i> for such smooth and hassle free journey, what a wonderfully organized learning retreat. All the stays and activities connected with inner transformations were beautifully managed.</i></p></h4><p> - admin</p></div><div class="border-bottom-thin"></div><div class="col-md-12"><h3 class="text-secondary">My Bali Experience</h3><h4><p><i>We all were immensely blessed in presence of </i><b><i>Guruji </i></b><i>&amp;</i><b><i> Guruma.</i></b></p><!--more--><p><b><i>BALI</i></b><i> !!!

They happened in a very informal manner between breakfast, teatime &amp; lunch.</i></p><p><i>Guruji explained to us the 3 most important Lessons for which we keep coming on this earth plane.They are Health ,Relationship, </i><i>&amp; Money. All our lives revolve around these issues .

A systematic learning approach with the right kind of </i><i> understanding will set us free from our karma malas was stressed upon.

It was hearttouching and great to see that in today"s world </i><i>far away from India people still appreciate , respect &amp; follow GANDHIGIRI. The yoga and dance performances </i><i>put up by the students of the ashram was commendable.</i></p><p><i>All the afternoon activities organised by Divine Explorer, were full of fun . Visits to Ubud cultural village , Baisakhi temple, Bali cultural and </i><i>spirit festival, Lord Tanna Lot temple ,sunset points, Kechak dance and delicious dinners.</i></p><p><i>Guruji &amp; Guruma, being with you we got to see the world in a different and beautiful way.

Our journey started with Navagraha temples, shifted to knowledge sessions under holy Arunachalam, we experienced bliss in Ramana Maharishi and Yogi Ram Surat Kumar’s cave/ashram and we successfully completed Karmashalan processes in Rameshwaram in systemic manner. As we soaked ourselves in healing waters of Coutrallam, we supplemented it with meditative fire in Velamma and Maha Avtar Babaji’s cave. Each day was so fulfilling that I could witness myself growing in Awareness and Understanding; Gurubandhus who joined in from 5 different countries played a key role in further shaping my understanding. Special gratitude to Anup and Rajdeep who with lot of love, explained finer details that I otherwise would have missed.</i></p><p><i>These camps are a MUST for a sincere seeker who is keen on growing faster; with each camp the intensity of learning, meditation and understanding is growing and so is the love in the Kriya family.</i></p><p><i>Deep gratitude and reverence to Guruji and Gurumaa who continue to pushing us to grow faster and realize Our True Self.</i></p><p><strong><i>Many thanks to Divine Explorer arranging such a smooth and hassle free travel, stay and activities for our inner journey. </i><br /></strong></p></h4><p> - Spiritual Seeker</p></div><div class="border-bottom-thin"></div></div><div class="border-bottom-thick"></div><div class="row p-3"><div class="col-md-12 hidden-xs"><h2 class="text-primary text-center">Our Popular Packages</h2></div></div><div class="border-bottom-thick"></div><div class="row"><div class=" d-md-flex justify-content-sm-center flex-md-row flex-sm-column"><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div class="thumbnail card text-center card-img-top mt-3"> <img src= "/images/Enlightenment divine travel_thumb.jpg" alt="Enlightenment Intensive Retreat"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title text-primary"> <b>Enlightenment Intensive Retreat</b></h4><p class="card-text"><p>Questions and answers that move your very being.  This unique learning module makes one question our own belief systems,</p></p><a href="/journeys/Enlightenment-Intensive-Retreat/" class="button" role="button">View More</a></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12"><div class="thumbnail card text-center card-img-top mt-3"> <img src= "/images/Bali spiritual journey(householder)_thumb.jpg" alt="Householders Spirituality"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title text-primary"> <b>Householders Spirituality</b></h4><p class="card-text"><p><strong>Embarking on a spiritual journey, is full of questions.
